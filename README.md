🍽 Zomato Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
by Murli Rathi

📘 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering on the Zomato dataset to uncover insights about restaurants across various countries.
It focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for further modeling or visualization.

The main notebook 1-eda-feature-engineering.ipynb includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Handling missing and duplicate values
Merging datasets
Feature extraction and encoding
Exploratory visualizations and insights
📂 Files in This Repository
File Name	Description
1-eda-feature-engineering.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook containing all steps of EDA and feature engineering.
zomato.csv	Main dataset containing restaurant information such as name, location, cuisine, and ratings.
Country-Code.xlsx	Reference file mapping Country Code to country names for merging with the main dataset.
🧩 Key Objectives
Data Cleaning

Handle null values and inconsistent data.
Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns.
Data Merging

Combine zomato.csv with Country-Code.xlsx to include country names.
Feature Engineering

Extract and encode relevant features (e.g., cuisines, price range, rating).
Convert categorical data into numerical form.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize relationships between cuisines, ratings, and locations.
Identify top cuisines, popular cities, and restaurant trends.
